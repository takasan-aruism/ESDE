ESDE KNOWN ISSUES

Last Updated: 2026-01-19
Version: v5.3.9-P8.9 (Synapse v3.0)

================================================================================
[ISSUE-001] Synapse Missing Concepts
================================================================================
Status: RESOLVED
Severity: Low
Affected: esde_synapses_v2_1.json (superseded by v3.0)

Description:
  7 out of 326 concepts had no synapse connections in v2.1.

Missing Concepts (v2.1):
  - FND.languageless
  - FND.memoryless
  - FND.spaceless
  - FND.temporality
  - MAT.bare_hand
  - PRP.shallow
  - WLD.nonscience
  - WLD.outer_realm

Root Cause:
  - v2.1 only searched WordNet using concept names
  - triggers_en from Glossary were not utilized
  - "-less" suffix, "non-" prefix, compound words not found

Resolution (2026-01-19):
  Synapse v3.0 implemented with triggers_en support.
  
  v2.1 → v3.0 comparison:
    - Total synsets: 2,037 → 11,557 (5.7x)
    - Total edges: 2,116 → 22,285 (10.5x)
    - Processed concepts: 320 → 326 (100%)
    - concepts_with_no_synsets: 7 → 0
  
  Files changed:
    - generate_synapses_v3.py (new)
    - esde_synapses_v3.json (new)
    - config.py: SYNAPSE_FILE updated
    - sensor/loader_synapse.py: import from config

================================================================================
[ISSUE-002] Chinese Characters in Glossary
================================================================================
Status: Open
Severity: Low
Affected: glossary_results.json

Description:
  6 lines contain Chinese characters (LLM generation artifact).

Affected Lines:
  - Line 6305:   "anti_tr得罪者_en"
  - Line 42965:  "actual": "Private judgment不受外界影响"
  - Line 69104:  "Family recipe传承"
  - Line 69541:  "actual": "Family recipe传扻"
  - Line 101483: "anti_tr得罪了_triggers_en"
  - Line 108665: "anti_tr得罪_en"

Root Cause:
  LLM (likely QwQ) mixed Chinese during generation.

Impact:
  Definition text only. Does not affect concept_id or synapse mapping.

Workaround:
  None required.

Future Fix:
  Clean up in Glossary v2.

Workaround:
  [Temporary solution if any]

Future Fix:
  [Planned resolution]

[ISSUE-004] WordNet Coverage Sufficiency Question
================================================================================
Status: RESOLVED (Monitoring)
Severity: Low
Affected: Foundation (Synapse)
First Noted: 2026-01

Description:
  Synapse generation relied solely on WordNet as the lexical source.
  Question: Is WordNet alone sufficient for ESDE coverage?

Original Concern:
  - v2.1 had 7 missing concepts (2.1%)
  - triggers_en not utilized
  - Potential need for auxiliary sources (Wiktionary, ConceptNet, etc.)

Resolution (2026-01-19):
  Synapse v3.0 fully utilizes triggers_en from Glossary.
  
  Results:
    - Missing concepts: 0 (was 7)
    - Unique search terms: 41,135 (was ~326)
    - WordNet coverage is now SUFFICIENT for current needs
  
  Conclusion:
    No additional lexical sources required at this time.
    WordNet + triggers_en provides adequate coverage.

Future Monitoring:
  - If Phase 9+ reveals systematic gaps, revisit this decision
  - Auxiliary sources remain an option but are not currently needed

[ISSUE-005] W6 Evidence Token Signature Separation
================================================================================
Status: Open
Severity: Low (P1)
Affected: discovery/w6_analyzer.py, discovery/w6_exporter.py
First Noted: 2026-01-22 (GPT Audit v5.4.6-P9.6-Final)

Description:
  In toy test data, both Dialog island and News island show identical
  top evidence token ('hey'), despite topology distance of 1.802233
  indicating near-opposite vectors.

Observed Behavior:
  - Island 1 (Dialog): top token = 'hey' (score: 0.035)
  - Island 2 (News):   top token = 'hey' (score: 0.035)
  - Topology distance: 1.802233 (nearly opposite direction)

Root Cause:
  NOT a W6 bug. W6 correctly extracts evidence from W3/W4.
  
  - Test data (toy dataset) has insufficient W3/W4 separation
  - Real-world data with distinct source_type distributions would
    show clearer token separation between islands
  - The shared 'hey' token appears in both W3 candidates with
    similar absolute S-Scores

Impact:
  - Does NOT affect W6 correctness or determinism
  - May confuse human reviewers if islands appear similar by top token
  - Mitigated by inspecting full evidence_tokens list

Constraint:
  INV-W6-004 (No New Math) prohibits adding new statistics in W6.
  Any "signature separation" metric would violate observation-only principle.

Workaround:
  - Review full evidence_tokens list in W6 export (not just top token)
  - Compare representative_vec_digest to see actual vector separation
  - Topology distance confirms structural difference despite token overlap

Future Fix:
  Add "Pair Inspect" display to W6 Exporter (Viewer layer, not computation):
  
  Option A: Exporter Enhancement (Recommended)
    - Display: A ∩ B (shared tokens)
    - Display: A − B (A-unique tokens)
    - Display: B − A (B-unique tokens)
    - Set operations are "display formatting", not "new computation"
  
  Option B: W7 Viewer Module
    - Defer to Phase 9-7 (Judgment Layer)
    - Human reviewer sees separation metrics during labeling
