================================================================================
[ISSUE-001] Synapse Missing Concepts
================================================================================
Status: RESOLVED
Severity: Low
Affected: esde_synapses_v2_1.json (superseded by v3.0)

Description:
  7 out of 326 concepts had no synapse connections in v2.1.

Missing Concepts (v2.1):
  - FND.languageless
  - FND.memoryless
  - FND.spaceless
  - FND.temporality
  - MAT.bare_hand
  - PRP.shallow
  - WLD.nonscience
  - WLD.outer_realm

Root Cause:
  - v2.1 only searched WordNet using concept names
  - triggers_en from Glossary were not utilized
  - "-less" suffix, "non-" prefix, compound words not found

Resolution (2026-01-19):
  Synapse v3.0 implemented with triggers_en support.
  
  v2.1 → v3.0 comparison:
    - Total synsets: 2,037 → 11,557 (5.7x)
    - Total edges: 2,116 → 22,285 (10.5x)
    - Processed concepts: 320 → 326 (100%)
    - concepts_with_no_synsets: 7 → 0
  
  Files changed:
    - generate_synapses_v3.py (new)
    - esde_synapses_v3.json (new)
    - config.py: SYNAPSE_FILE updated
    - sensor/loader_synapse.py: import from config

================================================================================
[ISSUE-002] Chinese Characters in Glossary
================================================================================
Status: Open
Severity: Low
Affected: glossary_results.json

Description:
  6 lines contain Chinese characters (LLM generation artifact).

Affected Lines:
  - Line 6305:   "anti_tr得罪者_en"
  - Line 42965:  "actual": "Private judgment不受外界影响"
  - Line 69104:  "Family recipe传承"
  - Line 69541:  "actual": "Family recipe传扻"
  - Line 101483: "anti_tr得罪了_triggers_en"
  - Line 108665: "anti_tr得罪_en"

Root Cause:
  LLM (likely QwQ) mixed Chinese during generation.

Impact:
  Definition text only. Does not affect concept_id or synapse mapping.

Workaround:
  None required.

Future Fix:
  Clean up in Glossary v2.

[ISSUE-004] WordNet Coverage Sufficiency Question
================================================================================
Status: RESOLVED (Monitoring)
Severity: Low
Affected: Foundation (Synapse)
First Noted: 2026-01

Description:
  Synapse generation relied solely on WordNet as the lexical source.
  Question: Is WordNet alone sufficient for ESDE coverage?

Original Concern:
  - v2.1 had 7 missing concepts (2.1%)
  - triggers_en not utilized
  - Potential need for auxiliary sources (Wiktionary, ConceptNet, etc.)

Resolution (2026-01-19):
  Synapse v3.0 fully utilizes triggers_en from Glossary.
  
  Results:
    - Missing concepts: 0 (was 7)
    - Unique search terms: 41,135 (was ~326)
    - WordNet coverage is now SUFFICIENT for current needs
  
  Conclusion:
    No additional lexical sources required at this time.
    WordNet + triggers_en provides adequate coverage.

Future Monitoring:
  - If Phase 9+ reveals systematic gaps, revisit this decision
  - Auxiliary sources remain an option but are not currently needed
